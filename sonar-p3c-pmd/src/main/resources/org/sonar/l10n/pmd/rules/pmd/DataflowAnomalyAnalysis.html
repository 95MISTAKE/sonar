The dataflow analysis tracks local definitions, undefinitions and references to variables on different paths on the data flow. From those informations there can be found various problems. 1. UR - Anomaly: There is a reference to a variable that was not defined before. This is a bug and leads to an error. 2. DU - Anomaly: A recently defined variable is undefined. These anomalies may appear in normal source text. 3. DD - Anomaly: A recently defined variable is redefined. This is ominous but don't have to be a bug.
