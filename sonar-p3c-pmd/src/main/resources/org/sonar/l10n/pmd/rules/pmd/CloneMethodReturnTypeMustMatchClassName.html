<p>
  If a class implements cloneable the return type of the method clone() must be the class name. That way, the caller of
  the clone method doesnâ€™t need to cast the returned clone to the correct type.
</p>
<p>
  Note: This is only possible with Java 1.5 or higher.
</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>
public class Foo implements Cloneable {
    @Override
    protected Object clone() { // Violation, Object must be Foo
    }
}

public class Foo implements Cloneable {
    @Override
    public Foo clone() { //Ok
    }
}
</pre>
