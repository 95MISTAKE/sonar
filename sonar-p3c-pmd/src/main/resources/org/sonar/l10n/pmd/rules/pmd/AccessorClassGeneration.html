Instantiation by way of private constructors from outside of the constructor's class often causes the generation of an accessor. A factory method, or non-privitization of the constructor can eliminate this situation. The generated class file is actually an interface. It gives the accessing class the ability to invoke a new hidden package scope constructor that takes the interface as a supplementary parameter. This turns a private constructor effectively into one with package scope, and is challenging to discern.
