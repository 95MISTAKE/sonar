This rule uses the NCSS (Non Commenting Source Statements) algorithm to determine the number of lines of code for a given type. NCSS ignores comments, and counts actual statements. Using this algorithm, lines of code that are split are counted as one.

  This rule is deprecated, use {rule:common-java:InsufficientCommentDensity} instead.
