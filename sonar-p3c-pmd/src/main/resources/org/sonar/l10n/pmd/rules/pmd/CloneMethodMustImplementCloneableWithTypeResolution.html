The method clone() should only be implemented if the class implements the Cloneable interface with the exception
of a final method that only throws CloneNotSupportedException. This version uses PMD's type resolution facilities,
and can detect if the class implements or extends a Cloneable class. Example:
<pre>
public class MyClass {
  public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
    return foo;
  }
}
</pre>
