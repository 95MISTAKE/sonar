<p>
  Unused Private Method detects when a private method is declared but is unused. This PMD rule should be switched off
  and replaced by its equivalent from Squid that is more effective : it generates less false-positives and detects more
  dead code.

  This rule is deprecated, use {rule:squid:UnusedPrivateMethod} instead.
