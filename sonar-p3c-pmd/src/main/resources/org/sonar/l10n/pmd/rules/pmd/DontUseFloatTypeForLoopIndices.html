Don't use floating point for loop indices. If you must use floating point, use double
unless you're certain that float provides enough precision and you have a compelling
performance need (space or time). Example:
<pre>
public class Count {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    final int START = 2000000000;
    int count = 0;
    for (float f = START; f < START + 50; f++)
      count++;
      //Prints 0 because (float) START == (float) (START + 50).
      System.out.println(count);
      //The termination test misbehaves due to floating point granularity.
    }
}
</pre>
